#Module one Final Project
1. For this project, simple command line CRUD app has been chosen. It was built with OO design patterns and active record to access Sqlite3.
2. It is named Airline booking, which gives an opportunity for a user to book flights
3. The following models have been used: Passenger, Airline, Flight, Booking, Review.
4. There a few user stories for this pp
    * User can book a flight, see booked flight, update and delete it 
    * User can leave comment and rating to the airline which he/she took flight through
    * User can see, update or delete that rating with review
5. CLI was used to display results and interact with a user.

 # Installation guides 
 1.  #Bundle install is  required to install necessary gems for this project
 2. After installing it, the following step is to run the next command: 
 ruby bin/console.rb to get to our CLI display. (As our domain models are structured, user is passenger in our domain model.)
 3. After running that command, the app asks the user to enter name and that username will be saved as user_id
 4. Then user has a menu of options to choose from 1-8, which are user stories. 
 5. Shortcut for going back from one of these options is to presss 0 and enter
